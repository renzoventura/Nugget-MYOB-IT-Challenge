Stunning views, food and service. I cannot wait to come back!! We didn't have to wait for a table, we were seated right by the window gazing out over the beach and the food was prompt to the table. I ordered the agria galette with bacon and it was scrumptious! The agria galette was soft and flavoursome, the egg was perfectly cooked and so was the bacon. The salted caramel gelato shake was a perfect addition to the meal. Light and creamy and perfectly sweet.
Their duck fat potatoes were very yum but pizzas were quite different to what we imagined! Very healthy Right by the beach area so a very lovely location Perfect for a weekend drove through mission bay and a food stop here
Know this restaurant from Zomato.Found out is the same as Takapuna Beach Cafe. Cheaper price with more variety of choice. But if you like fish and chips you can go to Takapuna Beach Cafe. Bigger portion.
Love this place for weekend lunches! The oysters are some of the best and most fresh that I've tasted in a restaurant! They had a good selection of wine to match and an awesome atmosphere with attentive staff and right across from the beach so you have amazing views to match!
Good food, great,stylish fitout and yummy food.the sparking water is a nice touch! Great menu selection! Like many of its sister restaurants (Rosie and Takapuna Beach Cafe) it's a stylish venue! Only quam is the number of people that are crammed into and inside space in winter. Great tho and a purge cut breakfast or lunch choice -best of the bays!
This place has the sophisticated, modern vibe down to a tee. Although it's a bit out of the way for me, the beach view and excellent service is worth coming back for!
