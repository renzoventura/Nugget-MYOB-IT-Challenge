Very nice environment to start with, a little bit hidden but it's really nice to be in. Food was amazing, I ordered the lamb and it was so yum. The meat was so tender and risotto was yum. I would love a bit better seasoning but over all awesome experience. My mates ordered burger, pizza, fish and chips and pork. But the lamb was the best dish to stand out. Highly recommended.
The best thing about this place is the staff. So professional yet so friendly at the same time. Such a great location. Oh and then theres the food! Such a great selection and great flavours! Loved the lamb Pizzette. And then theres the cake deli... the jam doughnut WOW love love love. you must try this place
Went to St Heliers Cafe and Bistro for dinner tonight. Fantastic food and wine and a very good waiter. The fish of the day was Blue Nose which was cooked to perfection and we also had the lamb which was easy to pull apart and cooked and presented beautifully. The desert menu is highly recommended. A great night out and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended.
