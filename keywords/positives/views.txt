Love this place for weekend lunches! The oysters are some of the best and most fresh that I've tasted in a restaurant! They had a good selection of wine to match and an awesome atmosphere with attentive staff and right across from the beach so you have amazing views to match!
St Heliers Cafe &amp; Bistro has become a new regular of mine. From the excellent food, to stunning views and great staff, if you are in St Heliers for a meal, look no further. For brunch I would highly recommend their Fried agria &amp; caramelised onion hash with rocket &amp; a poached egg. Simply delish!
