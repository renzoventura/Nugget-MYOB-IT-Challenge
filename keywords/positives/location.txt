Their duck fat potatoes were very yum but pizzas were quite different to what we imagined! Very healthy Right by the beach area so a very lovely location Perfect for a weekend drove through mission bay and a food stop here
I love going to St Heliers cafe as its location is stunning! One of our favourite spots for a girls' brunch. The food is great and the service is great. The only downside is that everytime we go we feel a bit pressured to leave (due to being super busy all the time).
I've visited a few times for a quick ice-cream stop while at the beach; the flavours are true to the names and so delicious, while the texture is always very creamy and smooth. I love the location of the cafe, and it's so nice to sit by the open windows on a warm summers day. As with the other HIP group restaurants, their service is always very professional & friendly, but they do have the option to add a tip at the till, so sometimes it can be a little bit intense..!
We had lunch here a few weeks ago and it was outstanding. All of the staff there were attentive, friendly and the service was fast! We took our 5 week old baby (first lunch out!), so we didn't want to have to wait too long. Even though the restaurant was heaving, our meals came very quickly. There were other kids and babies there, a mixed clientele of all types and the atmosphere was welcoming, buzzing and friendly, as well as professional. The menu and food is divine, we were very impressed. All in all, the food, service, decor and location are all fantastic. We're really excited to have a really quality cafe &amp; restaurant in the area, with top notch food &amp; service to match!
