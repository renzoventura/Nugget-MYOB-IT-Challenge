One of the nicest Cafe /Bistro in Auckland loved the atmosphere. Super busy..at dinner but lovely service and amazing food. Highly recommend to all.
Food was EXCELLENT - Definitely recommend the slow roast lamb, it was so tender and flavoursome. On the other hand, the duck fat potatoes was so delicious and roasted to perfection! We'll definitely be coming back for dinner sometime and look forward to try the panna cotta
Came for dinner last night - menu is very fancy, presentation is amazing and staff are friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was relaxed and the view was great. I want to go back and try the whole menu!
Love where this restaurant is located. It's so nice in summer with the big windows open and the view of the sea and nice breeze . If you feel like a relaxing evening, delicioys dinner and yummy cocktails then it's a must
The pizetta... Omg... I could be happy with two as my dinner haha! The food, service and ambiance are all great here! We came here on a Saturday night and it was busy! We ended up sitting closer to the kitchen on a shared table where we were happy to stay - they made sure to ask if we wanted a seat when it became free :)
Have been in for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed
Went to St Heliers Cafe and Bistro for dinner tonight. Fantastic food and wine and a very good waiter. The fish of the day was Blue Nose which was cooked to perfection and we also had the lamb which was easy to pull apart and cooked and presented beautifully. The desert menu is highly recommended. A great night out and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended.
