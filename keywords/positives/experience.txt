Have come here a few times, although hadn't been in a while due to the fact it isn't the local option. Honestly exceeds my expectations each time, staff are very attentive and made sure the experience was a good one. The eggs benedict and the iced chocolate were delicious - and both beautifully presented. Incredible atmosphere and high on my list when choosing somewhere to eat. Loved the Snapchat content.
My second time here, always enjoy their lovely service - genuine host, friendly staff, very welcoming atmosphere. Great food, definitely recommend their Pizza, perhaps the best I've had in town (thin base with rich flavorous toppings). What's amazing about this place, I think, is you are given a fine dining experience with a homy warm touch.
No cafe is ever going to satisfy everyone, but I'd say this cafe is pretty perfect. Judging from how busy the place is, St Heliers Bar and bistro maintains a consistently top notch cafe experience and they are generous with their staff numbers who are well trained- they make sure the customers are enjoying their meal without being overbearing.
